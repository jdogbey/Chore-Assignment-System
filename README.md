# Chore-Assignment-System
java based chore scheduler 


Created a Chore Assignment System (Java) that efficiently schedules household chores for multiple individuals while ensuring fair distribution and preventing frequent repetition of tasks. The system maintains a list of available chores and assigns them dynamically based on current logic for task allocation, user interaction, and the management of chore frequency, in order to showcase my programming and problem-solving skills.
